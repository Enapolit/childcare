        <p>When Carmen Hurd gave birth to her son last year, she knew caring for him would be a lot of work, but she never imagined it would become her full-time job. 
But when Hurd, a former farm manager from Fort Wayne, Indiana, discovered that infant care programs in her area charged more than $1,000 a month, she knew quitting her job to look after her son made a lot of financial sense. 
	“Daycare wasn’t an option, so I was a stay-at-home mom right from the start,” said Hurd. 
Hurd is one of 110 million US adults struggling to access child care, an essential — and in many developed nations, heavily-subsidized — service that has long been too scarce or too pricey for the majority of US families. 
During the pandemic, many day care centers struggled to compensate their employees as they contended with forced closures, enrollment fluctuations and social distancing regulations that limited capacity and revenue. Nearly 16,000 childcare centers and licensed family childcare programs permanently closed between December 2019 and March 2021, according to a report from Child Care Aware. And while generous pandemic-era grants helped resuscitate child care after the pandemic nearly decimated the industry last year, advocates say lawmakers must sustain that level of funding to protect an already vulnerable system from teetering over the brink of collapse.
	Cindy Lehnhoff, director of the National Child Care Association says an investment in the child care industry is also a critical investment in the US economy. Before the pandemic, the US economy lost $57 billion annually due to child care shortages.
	“Lawmakers are investing a lot of money in what I call ‘concrete’ bills — funding infrastructure like roads and bridges — but we tell them that’s not going to do much if you don’t have a bill that invests in the foundation of society, which is human infrastructure.” said Lehnhoff “Without that investment in human infrastructure, you won’t have the people to build the roads or the bridges.”
Since the late 1980s, child care grants have comprised a very small slice of the federal budget. Before the pandemic, states usually received between $3 and $5 billion dollars toward early childhood subsidy programs and financial support programs for daycares. That’s just between 7 and 12 percent of the $42 billion dollars American families spent on early childhood education and infant care programs in 2021. 
	Over the years, advocates have tried and failed to convince lawmakers to funnel more money into early childhood programs. But it wasn’t until the pandemic hit that lawmakers had enough political will to act. 
 In March 2021, lawmakers passed the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 Stimulus package that included $39 billion in emergency funding to stabilize the child care sector. 
But while the act did provide daycares with aid to increase sanitation measures and boost workers’ wages, it didn’t help more families qualify for aid or eliminate many of the barriers to applying for aid. 
 Some states have stepped in to fill some of the gaps left by ARPA, however. 
 On May 1, New Mexico passed a bill that would funnel ARPA aid into grants that would provide copayment-free child care to families earning up to 400% of the state’s median income.  Previously, only families at 200% FPL or below qualified for waived copayments. The program, which would grant a year of free childcare to 30,000 additional families before federal pandemic funding dries up in 2023, is an early experiment in universal child care. 
“It’s free, no more co-pays, no more waiting,” New Mexico Gov. Lujan Grisham said to an audience of preschoolers at East Gate Kids Learning Center in Albuquerque after the bill was passed. “This is the road to a universal child-care system.”
	At the federal level, Democrats are also attempting to pass a bill called the X, which would limit the copays of families earning up to 400% of their state’s median income to 7% of a family’s total income. Nationwide, only one in six families that are in need of child care subsidies will receive them. 
	Grant Blitzke, a community coordinator at Family Help Network in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who works to connect qualifying families with high-quality child care centers that accept childcare vouchers, estimates more than fifty percent of families who call him for assistance are ineligible for child care subsidies by a small margin. 
“Oftentimes we receive calls from families looking for access to subsidies or vouchers  who are making just over the maximum income [to receive child care subsidies],” said Blitzke. “If they were to pay for child care out of pocket, it would almost not be worth it for them to work. I think even people that are considered well off still find that childcare is expensive for them, in a lot of cases.”
But while New Mexico’s ambitious bill could serve as a lodestone for other states, and perhaps even the federal government; it's unclear when the program will begin and whether the state has the infrastructure and administrative capabilities to pull it off. 
	Elizabeth Arnold, a farm owner and freelance graphic designer who lives in a rural suburb of Albuquerque, New Mexico, says her two experiences applying for child care through New Mexico’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department (ECECD) over the past three years were nightmares. 
	Arnold first began researching infant care programs just a few days after her daughter’s first birthday. Before that, she would strap her daughter to her back so she could complete chores around the farm. But both Arnold and her daughter grew tired of multitasking. 
	“If I have to carry her then it's hard for me to lift things, and there was a limit to how much she would tolerate.”
	Arnold began to research infant care programs in her community and drove to the ECECD office to apply for childcare assistance. 
	When she arrived at the office, baby in her arms, there was nobody there to greet her. Arnold seated herself and waited for over three hours to be seen by a caseworker. 
“I was sitting there breastfeeding in this tiny little room full of broken dirty toys just waiting and waiting to meet with someone,” said Arnold.
Arnold visited the office several more times over the next two months when she encountered various issues providing the documentation for her application. She was told she could not complete any of the forms online or by email. 
When Arnold's application was eventually approved, her daughter started daycare. But after several months, Arnold realized she wasn’t happy with the quality of care her daughter was receiving.
“That place was just like ok give us your daughter and we’ll have her back at five,” said Arnold. “After switching [to a new child care center], I was kind of ashamed that I let my daughter stay at the first place.”
Arnold realized she had to send her daughter to an accredited center to get the level of care she expected, but accredited centers were hard to come by in her small town. 
Across the US, 51% of families live in child care deserts, where access to quality care is hard to come by. While Arnold did have access to home-based providers and other care in her hometown, there were no accredited daycares in her town. 
After a lot of thought, Arnold decided to enroll her daughter at Pando Little school, a daycare in Albuquerque that’s about an hour’s drive from her home. 
In order to switch day care centers, Arnold had to apply for a government-subsidized seat through the ECECD. While the pandemic had forced the ECECD to move the application process online, the process was still arduous. This time it took four months to complete. 
Arnold paid for her daughter’s tuition herself while she waited on the aid because she wanted to secure her daughter’s spot at Pando.When she didn’t have enough money, she would borrow some from her mother.
	Melissa Scott, the director of Pando Little School, says daycare spots are extremely limited. At one point during the pandemic, Pando Little School had as many as 500 families on its waiting list.  
	Due to the fact that the competition for available spots is so high, and due to the fact that  government “contract” daycare spots cost less than spots that are paid for by families out of pocket, many spots go to those who can pay the center upfront, leaving families that qualify for government assistance unable to use the aid they receive. 
Scott says she would like to charge parents the difference between the government contract price and the full-tuition price, but to do so would be illegal. 
“I have the really uncomfortable decision of telling [families] they can go somewhere if they want to use the contract, knowing that no one else has a spot for them, or they can pay full tuition,” said Scott. “I want families to get whatever financial break they can, but I also still need to be able to afford to run things.” 
With rising wages in other service industries convincing more and more daycare workers to leave the field, spots for children all across the country could become ever fewer. 
Scott says she hasn’t struggled with retention as much as other centers because she’s constantly working on boosting morale, but she admits she struggles to pay her workers what they deserve, even after using some of the COVID grants she received toward boosting her teachers’ pay. 
“I have teachers with multiple master’s degrees and I would love to pay them more, but I just can’t pay them as much as other businesses would,” said Scott “But, of course, I would love to pay them what they’re worth.”
