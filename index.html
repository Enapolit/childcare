        <p>America’s solar energy industry has survived pandemic-driven global supply chain issues and shipping disruptions.But there’s one obstacle the solar industry might struggle to overcome — mounting prices. 
</p>

        <p>Prices for residential photovoltaic (PV) systems have risen nearly 50% over the past year as the prices of component materials like polysilicon, steel, glass and copper continue to rise. </p>

        <p> The situation could be a knife-edge for the thriving residential solar industry that has emerged along America’s sunbelt. That is because the long-term cost benefit of solar energy for consumers is what entices many homeowners to make the switch to solar. 
</p>

        <p>But now, with prices rising and the end of government subsidies for home PV systems on the horizon, consumer interest in solar energy could wane. 
</p>

        <p>Here are the materials that are causing PV system prices to hit new highs: </p>

                    <h3>Frame</h3>
                    <p>Steel is used for the frame of PV systems. 
Steel is up 215% since March 2020. In fact, hot-rolled steel climbed to a high of $1,825 this year. Before the pandemic, steel traded between $500 and $800.

                    <h3>Solar Cells</h3>
                    <p>Polysilicon is used for the solar cells of PV systems. 
Polysilicon is up 300% — a ten-year high. The cost of solar panel raw material polysilicon topped $40/kg this month, according to the China Nonferrous Metals Association,

                    <h3>Junction Box</h3>
                    <p>Copper is used in the junction boxes of PV systems. 
The price of copper increased 13-% over the past year. Copper prices soared to new highs in 2021 and broke records in March of 2022 when the cost of copper topped $5.00 per pound.
